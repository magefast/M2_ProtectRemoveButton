# Extension for Magento 2: Protect Remove Button

This extension will hide REMOVE / DELETE buttons for followings:
- Category, Delete Button on Edit Page 
- Product
  - Delete Button Mass Action
  - Delete Button List Actions
- CMS Page
  - Delete Button on Edit Page 
  - Delete Button Mass Action
  - Delete Button List Actions
- CMS Block
  - Delete Button on Edit Page 
  - Delete Button Mass Action
  - Delete Button List Actions
- Attribute, Delete Button on Edit Page
- Attribute Set, Delete Button on Edit Page


For my opinion this extension MUST HAVE for first, before run in Production.
Very often CMS managers/Content editors - make mistake, remove Categories or Products.
This is very harmful and danger for SALES.


#### The Extension ProtectRemoveButton - resolve problem with wrong click on The Remove Button.

### The extension only hide button and not protect by action via API etc.

## Settings

- Go to Menu Item **Stores** -> **Configuration**
