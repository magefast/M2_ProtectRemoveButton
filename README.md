# Extension for Magento 2: ProtectRemoveButton

This extension will hide REMOVE buttons for followings:
- Category
- Product
- CMS Page
- CMS Block


For my opinion this extension MUST HAVE for first, before run in Production.
Very often CMS managers/Content editors - make mistake, remove Categories or Products.
This is very harmful and danger for SALES.


#### The Extension ProtectRemoveButton - resolve problem with wrong click on The Remove Button.

### The extension only hide button and not protect by action via API etc.
