# Extension for Magento 2: Protect Remove Button

This extension will hide REMOVE / DELETE buttons for followings:
- Category
- Product Delete Button Mass Action
- CMS Page
- CMS Block




For my opinion this extension MUST HAVE for first, before run in Production.
Very often CMS managers/Content editors - make mistake, remove Categories or Products.
This is very harmful and danger for SALES.


#### The Extension ProtectRemoveButton - resolve problem with wrong click on The Remove Button.

### The extension only hide button and not protect by action via API etc.

## Settings

- Go to Menu Item **Stores** -> **Configuration**
- In left menu - **Protect Remove Button** -> **Settings for Disable Action Buttons**
- Add Settings for Disable Action Buttons
